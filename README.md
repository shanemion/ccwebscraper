Created to help automate the emailing process to every organization in Cardinal Commitment (website: https://cardinalservice.stanford.edu/opportunities?su_opp_dimension%5B%5D=486#filter-wrapper). Emails and organizations from this list were then added into a spreadsheet and a separate function utilizing Apps Script on spreadsheets was created and run to send the emails, inputting appropriate titles when necessary. Saved an immennse amount of tedious hours of emailing manually and avoided using a third party service; process is reusable and will be used to update and inquire about contact information, new leaderships, and new developments in the future.
